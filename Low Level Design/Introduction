Low Level Design 
LLD, or Low-Level Design, is a phase in the software development process where detailed system components and their interactions are specified. It involves converting the high-level design into a more detailed blueprint, addressing specific algorithms, data structures, and interfaces. LLD serves as a guide for developers during coding, ensuring the accurate and efficient implementation of the systemâ€™s functionality. LLD describes class diagrams with the help of methods and relations between classes and program specs.
